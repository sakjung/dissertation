## Discovering Company-Specific Key Risk and Success Factors of Music Streaming Subscription Management by Analysing App Store Reviews: A Case Study of Tidal Music Streaming Service
***by Jung Seok Sung***

### Executive Summary

Within the intensively competitive global music streaming market, Tidal has been struggling to maintain its own streaming service. Tidal’s current financial state became highly vulnerable to the changes in the number of subscribers, as most of its revenue excessively relies on the sales of subscriptions. In order to ensure a stable subscriber base, it is necessary to recognise the current state of the service and construct proper business strategies accordingly. Therefore, this study aims to suggest a framework to diagnose key risk and success factors of Tidal’s subscription management by analysing Appstore reviews. Subscription management in this context is defined as managing the streaming service with the goal of retaining existing subscribers while attracting potential subscribers. Based on a review of the literature on key factors of premium subscription and Appstore reviews analysis, this research first collected a total of 104,743 reviews, 10,668 reviews from the Apple App Store and 94,075 reviews from the Google Play Store. Reviews text data were then properly processed for the analysis. The prepared data was then ingested into Structural Topic Modelling (STM) to figure out latent topics within the reviews. The topics are ranked through a ranking model and grouped by their origin (Apple or Google) and direction (Risk or Success). The analysis showed various company-specific key factors that threaten or strengthen the subscription management and each factor has its own characteristics in terms of topic features in the ranking model, which are topic volume, topic polarity, and topic timeliness. Based on these results, practitioners can try various interpretations of the factors and implement a more sophisticated SWOT relevant analysis to set business strategies.
